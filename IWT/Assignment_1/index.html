    <h1>Web Technology Basics</h1>
    <p>Web development plays a crucial role in today’s digital world by enabling individuals, businesses, and
        organizations to establish a strong online presence. A well-developed website acts as a central platform for
        sharing information, delivering services, and engaging with users across the globe. From simple personal blogs
        to complex enterprise applications, web development ensures that content is accessible, responsive, and
        functional on different devices. As the internet continues to shape how people communicate and consume
        information, web development becomes essential for visibility, credibility, and growth.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond visibility, web development drives innovation and efficiency by integrating modern technologies such as
        cloud computing, APIs, and data-driven systems. Well-structured and secure web applications improve user
        experience, automate processes, and support scalable solutions for growing demands. In industries like
        education, healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, web development enables faster services, better accessibility,
        and real-time interaction. As digital transformation accelerates, the importance of web development continues to
        grow, making it a foundational skill and a key contributor to technological progress.
